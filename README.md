1. We pick option 2 because you don't want to push code that fails function calls which will have bugs that can ruin projects.
2. No, end-to-end testing is used more for testing the functionality of the entire project, in this case unit testing would suit better for testing a singular function.
3. Snapshot analyzes a page in its current state vs navigation analyzes a page when it loads.

   - One of the things to improve is that the images must be properly sized by that we mean we could ship smaller images so that 
     it's easier to load.
   - We could switch from current jpg to png images because it requires less data consumption.
   - The last thing is that we could preconnect to the api first before loading into the webpage such that it speeds up future        webpage loads.
